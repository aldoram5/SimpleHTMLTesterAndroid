# SimpleHTMLTesterAndroid

Simple HTMLTester is an Android app designed to help developers and enthusiasts to write and test HTML and Javascript right from their Android device.

Initially it began as a Titanium Appcelerator App(you can find the original app repo [here](https://github.com/aldoram5/SimpleHTMLTester)), but now this is getting re-written as a native Java Android App, so it can get extended more easily without requiring to depend on 3rd parties software.
